Project name: nos2x-fox

## Description
nos2x-fox is a Firefox browser extension that acts as a Nostr signer (NIP-07). It provides a `window.nostr` object to web applications, allowing them to sign Nostr events and perform encryption/decryption operations without exposing private keys.
The extension includes optional PIN protection (AES-GCM-256 encryption) for securing private keys, with an ephemeral PIN cache that lasts 10 minutes.
Built with React, TypeScript, and WebExtension APIs (Manifest V2), using esbuild for bundling. It's a fork of the original nos2x Chrome extension, adapted for Firefox and related browsers.

For more functional information you see the README.md file.
