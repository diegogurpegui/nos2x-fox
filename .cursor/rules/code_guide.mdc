## Code guidelines
- **DRY**: Do not Repeat Youself.  
  Reuse code when available and appropriate
- **KISS**: Keep It Simple Stupid.  
  Code has to be as simple as possible as long as the purpose is being fulfilled.
- Do not add any external library of package. You can only use what is already a dependecy of the project.
- Whenever you make a change that affects user experience explicitely, and it's related to something already mentioned in the README.md file, then update it.
- Whenever possible, group pieces of related code toghered. For example functions that work on similar stuff, variables or enums that reference similar stuff, etc.
